An Android UI to integrate with a "Big Brother" Project - a program made using OpenCV and Firebase that analyzes situations through live video processing
and can detect dangerous situations that might occur.
This Android application is used to control what the user wants the system to identify and alert to.

- Choose notifiers to notify about.
- Watch a report that summerizes events that the system identified.

This project can be used as a security system or even babysitting.
